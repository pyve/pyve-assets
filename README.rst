Python Venezuela is trademarks of the `Fundaci√≥n Python de Venezuela <http://pyve.github.io/fundacion/>`_.

Python Venezuela logo, was created by `Francisco Palm <https://github.com/map0logo>`_.

In general, we want the logo to be used as widely as possible to indicate the support of or involvement with Python Venezuela community. If you are a local PyVe community leader, you are free to adapt the logo to your location. However, non-leaders, please `ask via a new issues <https://github.com/pyve/pyve-assets/issues/new>`_ first when using a derived version of the logo or when in doubt.


The PyVe Logo
-------------

The standard PyVe logo (cursive writing) can be found in the `community <https://github.com/pyve/pyve-assets/tree/master/locations>`_ directory of this repository. You may alter the colors of the logo but not the size or proportions.


T-Shirts & Other Merchandise
----------------------------

Making your own shirts is OK too, but please seek permission from the `PyVe leadership <https://github.com/pyve/pyve-assets/issues/new>`_ if you are planning to sell merchandise that shows the PyVe logo.


Derivative Work
---------------

If you are a local PyVe leader, you are free to adapt the logo to your location. Some examples can be found in the `locations <https://github.com/pyve/pyve-assets/tree/master/locations>`_ directory.
